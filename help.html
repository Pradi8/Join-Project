            Welcome to the help page for <span class="c-b">Join</span>, your guide to
            using our kanban project management tool. Here, we'll provide an
            overview of what  <span class="c-b">Join</span> is, how it can benefit you, and

          <h6>What is  Join?</h6>
          <p>
            <span class="c-b">Join</span> is a kanban-based project management tool designed and built by
            a group of dedicated students as part of their web development
            bootcamp at the Developer Akademie.
          </p>
          <p>
            Kanban, a Japanese term meaning "billboard", is a highly effective
            method to visualize work, limit work-in-progress, and maximize
            efficiency (or flow). Join leverages the principles of kanban to
            help users manage their tasks and projects in an intuitive, visual
            interface.
          </p>

          </p>
          <h6>How to use it</h6>
          <p>Here is a step-by-step guide on how to use  <span class="c-b">Join</span>:</p>

          <ol>
            <li>
              <span class="list-headline">Exploring the Board </span> <br />
              <span>
                When you log in to  <span class="c-b">Join</span>, you'll find a default board. This board
                represents your project and contains four default lists: "To
                Do", "In Progress", “Await feedback” and "Done".</span
              >
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="list-headline">Creating Contacts</span> <br>
              <span
                >In  <span class="c-b">Join</span>, you can add contacts to collaborate on your projects.
                Go to the "Contacts" section, click on "New contact", and fill
                in the required information. Once added, these contacts can be
                assigned tasks and they can interact with the tasks on the
                board.</span
              >
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="list-headline">Adding Cards</span><br>
              <span>
                Now that you've added your contacts, you can start adding cards.
                Cards represent individual tasks. Click the "+" button under the
                appropriate list to create a new card. Fill in the task details
                in the card, like task name, description, due date, assignees,
                etc.</span
              >
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="list-headline">Moving Cards</span><br>
              <span>
                As the task moves from one stage to another, you can reflect
                that on the board by dragging and dropping the card from one
                list to another.</span
              >
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="list-headline">Deleting Cards</span><br>
              <span>
                Once a task is completed, you can either move it to the "Done"
                list or delete it. Deleting a card will permanently remove it
                from the board. Please exercise caution when deleting cards, as
                this action is irreversible. Remember that using  <span class="c-b">Join</span>
                effectively requires consistent updates from you and your team
                to ensure the board reflects the current state of your project.
