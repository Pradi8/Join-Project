            Some data are collected when you provide it to us. This could, for

          <p>
            Other data are collected automatically or after your consent when
            you visit the website by our IT systems. These data are primarily

          <h6>2. General Information and Mandatory Information</h6>
          <h3>Data Protection</h3>
          <p>
            The operators of this website take the protection of your personal
            data very seriously. We treat your personal data as confidential and
            in accordance with the statutory data protection regulations and
            this privacy policy.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you use this website, various pieces of personal data will be
            collected. Personal information is any data with which you could be
            personally identified. This privacy policy explains what information
            we collect and what we use it for. It also explains how and for what
            purpose this happens.
          </p>
          <p>
            Please note that data transmitted via the internet (e.g., via email
            communication) may be subject to security breaches. Complete
            protection of your data from third-party access is not possible.
          </p>

          <h3>Notice concerning the party responsible for this website</h3>
          <p>The party responsible for processing data on this website is:</p>
          <p>
            Group Join 284 of Developer Akademie<br />
            Philipp Lötzsch
          </p>
          <p>Email: philipp.loetzsch@outlook.com</p>
          <p>
            The responsible party is the natural or legal person who alone or
            jointly with others decides on the purposes and means of processing
            personal data (names, email addresses, etc.).
          </p>

          <h3>Storage duration</h3>
          <p>
            Unless a more specific storage period has been specified within this
            privacy policy, your personal data will remain with us until the
            purpose for the data processing no longer applies. If you assert a
            legitimate request for deletion or revoke your consent to data
            processing, your data will be deleted, provided we do not have other
            legally permissible reasons for storing your personal data (e.g.,
            tax or commercial law retention periods); in the latter case, the
            deletion will take place after these reasons cease to apply.
          </p>

          <h3>Recipients of personal data</h3>
          <p>
            In the course of our business activities, we collaborate with
            various external parties. This may also involve the transfer of
            personal data to these external parties. We only share personal data
            with external parties if this is necessary for contract fulfillment,
            if we are legally obliged to do so (e.g., transfer of data to tax
            authorities), if we have a legitimate interest according to Art. 6
            (1) lit. f DSGVO in the data transfer, or if another legal basis
            permits the data transfer. When using processors, we only share
            personal data of our customers based on a valid contract for order
            processing. In the case of joint processing, a contract for joint
            processing is concluded.
          </p>

          <h3>Revocation of your consent to data processing</h3>
          <p>
            Many data processing operations are only possible with your express
            consent. You can revoke your consent at any time. The legality of
            the data processing carried out until the revocation remains
            unaffected by the revocation.
          </p>

          <h3>
            Right to lodge a complaint with the competent supervisory authority
          </h3>
          <p>
            In the event of breaches of the DSGVO, data subjects have the right
            to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, in particular in
            the member state of their habitual residence, place of work, or the
            place of the alleged breach. The right to lodge a complaint is
            without prejudice to any other administrative or judicial remedies.
          </p>

          <h3>Right to data portability</h3>
          <p>
            You have the right to have data which we process based on your
            consent or in fulfillment of a contract automatically delivered to
            yourself or to a third party in a standard, machine-readable format.
            If you require the direct transfer of data to another responsible
            party, this will only be done to the extent technically feasible.
          </p>

          <h3>Information, correction, and deletion</h3>
          <p>
            As permitted by law, you have the right to be provided at any time
            with information free of charge about any of your personal data that
            is stored as well as its origin, the recipient, and the purpose for
            which it has been processed. You also have the right to have this
            data corrected or deleted. You can contact us at any time using the
            address given in our legal notice if you have further questions on
            the topic of personal data.
          </p>

          <h3>Right to restriction of processing</h3>
          <p>
            You have the right to request the restriction of the processing of
            your personal data. To do this, you can contact us at any time at
            the address given in the legal notice. The right to restriction of
            processing applies in the following cases:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              If you contest the accuracy of your personal data stored by us, we
              usually need time to verify this. For the duration of the
              verification, you have the right to request the restriction of the
              processing of your personal data.
            </li>
            <li>
              If the processing of your personal data was/is unlawful, you can
              request the restriction of data processing instead of deletion.
            </li>
            <li>
              If we no longer need your personal data but you need it to
              exercise, defend, or assert legal claims, you have the right to
              request the restriction of the processing of your personal data
              instead of deletion.
            </li>
            <li>
              If you have filed an objection pursuant to Art. 21 (1) DSGVO, your
              interests must be weighed against ours. As long as it is not yet
              clear whose interests prevail, you have the right to request the
              restriction of the processing of your personal data.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, this
            data may only be processed – apart from being stored – with your
            consent or for the assertion, exercise, or defense of legal claims
            or for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal
            person or for reasons of important public interest of the European
            Union or a member state.

            Our websites use so-called "cookies." Cookies are small data packets
            that do not harm your device. They are either temporarily stored for

          <p>
            Cookies can come from us (first-party cookies) or from third-party
            companies (so-called third-party cookies). Third-party cookies allow
            for the integration of certain third-party services within websites
            (e.g., cookies for processing payment services).
          </p>
          <p>
            Cookies serve various functions. Many cookies are technically
            necessary as certain website functions would not work without them
            (e.g., the shopping cart function or displaying videos). Other
            cookies may be used to analyze user behavior or for advertising
            purposes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Cookies that are required for the performance of electronic
            communications transactions, for providing certain functions you
            request (e.g., the shopping cart function), or for optimizing the
            website (e.g., cookies for measuring web audience) are stored on the
            basis of Art. 6(1)(f) DSGVO, unless a different legal basis is
            specified. The website operator has a legitimate interest in storing
            necessary cookies to ensure the technically error-free and optimized
            provision of its services. If consent for storing cookies and
            similar recognition technologies has been requested, processing
            occurs exclusively on the basis of that consent (Art. 6(1)(a) DSGVO
            and § 25(1) TTDSG); the consent can be withdrawn at any time.
          </p>
          <p>
